## Section 1: Core Java
## Section 2: Maven 
  - Introduction to Maven: 
      - Maven is a project management tool.
      - It is essential beyond syntax and concepts when building a project.
  - Project Building Steps:
      - Compilation of files.
      - Running files.
      - Testing files.
      - Creating a package.
      - Deployment.
  - External Libraries and Dependencies:
      - Projects often require external libraries.
      - Examples include connectors for database interaction (e.g., MySQL Connector for MySQL, Postgres Connector for Postgres).
      - Introduction to Hibernate as a tool for saving data in a database without SQL queries.
  - Library Retrieval in Java:
      - Libraries are obtained as JAR files.
      - Process involves searching and downloading from the internet.
      - Different IDEs support adding JAR files to the project.
  - Transitive Dependencies in Hibernate:
      - Hibernate requires multiple JAR files due to transitive dependencies.
      - Upgrading dependencies in the future may require redownloading.
  - Compatibility and Versioning:
      - Different frameworks may have their own dependencies.
      - Version compatibility between frameworks is crucial.
      - Matching versions ensures proper collaboration between frameworks.
  - Challenges with Manual Dependency Management:
      - Time-consuming process.
      - Potential issues when sharing projects with colleagues.
      - Synchronization of versions is critical.
  - Introduction to Maven as a Solution:
      - Maven streamlines the process of managing dependencies.
      - Automates the retrieval of dependencies.
      - Helps maintain version compatibility.
  - Other Project Management Tools:
      - Mention of other tools like Gradle and Ivy.
      - Selection of Maven for its beginner-friendly nature.
  - Focus on Dependency Management:
      - Emphasis on understanding Maven for handling dependencies.
      - Mention of Maven plugins for various project phases (compiling, testing, running), but the focus in this section is on dependencies.
